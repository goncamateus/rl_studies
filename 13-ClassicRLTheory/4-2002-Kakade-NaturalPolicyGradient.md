#### Gerenal Content

Shows in article that natural grandients is moving towards a greedy optimal action,
instead of just a better action.

Proposes and analyzes an algorithm connected to policy gradient

Show that the proposed method doesn't suffer much from the plateau phenomenom

#### Key take-aways
Complementing comtemporary kakade publication serves as basis for algorithms such as TRPO,
PPO.
Natural Gradients represents the steepest direction
Greedy Optimal action are the ones that would be choosen under one improvement step of
policy iteration with approximate, compatible value functions

#### Keypoints

The performance metric is better defined on the mainfold that the parameters coordinates
define.

shows compatibility with policy iteratoin methods

The presented method can be similar in the way tha natural gradient method moves toward
a policy improvement

In natural gradients perfomacne improbement is guaranteed

Asymptotically the method does not converge as well as policy gradients

#### Observations and Questions

I understood nothing from the paper
