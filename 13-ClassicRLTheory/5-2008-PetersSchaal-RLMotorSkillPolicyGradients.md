#### Gerenal Content

The studies here intends to apply at the time recent developments in reinforcement learning to
obtain a robotic human-like behavior of learning by trial-and-error

The first part show how motor primitives are suitable to be used to learn control policies

Secondly, motor primitives are combined with, at the time, state of art stochastic policy
learning.

The paper show that the Episodic Natural Actor-Critic algorithm outperforms the others
stochastic policy learning methods

They test the algorithm in the domain of hitting a baseball with an anthropomorphic arm

#### Key take-aways

Has a great explanation of the general policy gradient problem


#### Keypoints

Adds two components to the traditional reinforcement learning framework:
- A domain-specific policy representation for motor skills
- RL algorithms that work efficiently in the domain and scale to high dimension
continous domain as humanoid robots
